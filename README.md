# MacOS_Utilities_With_ChatGPT

Hey guys,

I've been using ChatGPT to write various utilities and I'm going to start sharing them.

find_unmanaged_apps.sh -- finds all apps that are in Homebrew and offers to replace them with the homebrew version
transcode_to_hevc[_recusrive] converts all non-HECV videos in a directory to HEVC.  _recusrive does it recusrively
update-software updates Homebrew apps -- it's a scheduled task

looping_script.sh is just a helper to run bash scripts in a loop
