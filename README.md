# MacOS_Utilities_With_ChatGPT

I've been using ChatGPT to write various utilities for myself and I'm going to start sharing them.

* find_unmanaged_apps.sh -- finds all apps that are in Homebrew and offers to replace them with the homebrew version
* transcode_to_hevc[_recursively] converts all non-HECV videos in a directory to HEVC.  _recursive does it recursively
* update-software updates Homebrew apps -- it's a scheduled task
* looping_script.sh is just a helper to run bash scripts in a loop
